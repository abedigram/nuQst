# 4 data & vuex
### 1
- intro
### 2
- load posts in a loop
### 3
- fetch data in created() hook is bad for SEO
- asyncData() is the solution
    - works only on **pages**
    - is placed top of data()
    - waits to finish then send page to client
    - **this** or any other field of page does not work on it. cause comp. is not created yet
    - has special args and notation. check it! 
### 5
- asyncData executes on the server!
    - its console.logs print on server console not browser console
    - but if it is accessed for not first time using nuxt-link or route.push it runs on browser because seo does not matter anymore (engine has crawled it once first time)
### 6
- asyncData's context object has some usful things when **this** is not available
### 7
- load single post content dynamically
- use context.route.params.** to access route params or ...
### 8
- callback obj of asyncData has an error field to send errors and it redirects app to 404 page
- using a promise instead of callback
    - use context's error field and catch to send error
### 9
- using promise resolve and reject instead of callback 
- promise is behind the scenes of modules like Axios, not used directly most times
### 11
- vuex
    - config store file
    - save data into store on postsList page
### 12
- fetch method is the same as asyndData but does not merge with data() field
    - ex. is used to set store data on vuex + vuex commit method
    - the better solution is to store data on veux config file with nuxtServerInit() func
- use vuex store to store frequenly accessed data
### 13
- wrap up
